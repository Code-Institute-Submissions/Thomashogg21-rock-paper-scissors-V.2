# Rock Paper Scissors

## A functional Rock Paper Scissors game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can choose between Rock, Paper and Scissors against the computer. Who will win?


Rock Paper Scissors is a great game that everyone knows! We often use it to help when no one can seem to make a decision, the winner is usually settled in regards to the "best of three" rule, but you're fine to play as many games as you like, of course. However, since it is the computer that is playing and not a human the outcome will be 100% random, also meaning fairer results.


## What the page includes

- Your options
    - There are three interactive options to choose from: Rock, Paper and Scissors, with some text taunting you to click on one.


- Results 
    - When one of the choice images are selected the correlating option is selected.
    - JavaScript chooses its own option out of the three and compares the two to determine the winner.


- Score counter
    - A player will gain a point when they win a game of RPS and the counter will increase by 1.
    - Neither player will gain a point when there is a draw.

## More to include

- I would definitely love to include some animation to the game in the future, i feel as if it would make the game a little bit more fun.
